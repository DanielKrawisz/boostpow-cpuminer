# CPU Miner for Boost

This c++ program depends on the Gigamonkey repository and is designed to pull in all its dependencies via conan. It shall also be pulished as a conan package so that other c++ programs can easily pull it in as a dependency where needed.

For distribution it is meant that this repository may be built for mac, linux, and windows, as well as packaged for Docker. Ideally also there will be an apt package repository where one can install by running `apt-get install boost-miner`.
